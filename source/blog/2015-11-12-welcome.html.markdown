# This is Your First Blog Post

You should probably remove this blog post and make your own!

Feel free to use the following YAML frontmatter for changing the default social sharing options about your blog post:

- `title`
- `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss TZ`), but all you really need is `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `twitter_creator` if the creator of the blog post is not `site.twitter_handle`
- `seo_image` if you want to override `site.seo_banner`
- `twitter_card_type` if you want to override `"summary"`
- `preferred_url` if there is a preferrel canonical URL
